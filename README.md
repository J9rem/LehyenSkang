This project proposes a **light** content management system ([CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)) based on [PicoCMS](https://github.com/picocms/Pico).

The aim is to be able to easy install and use this software for your website without management of database, or other complicated staff but with a secured and light software.

## Installation

The easy way to install LehyenSkang is not already available.

**I'am a developer** : [Installation's documentation](./docs/en/install.md)

## Why this name ?

`LehyenSkang` seems not to exist. This is an English pronounceable notation to come closer to [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language) terms `Lec'hienn Skañv` which mean `light site`.

## Detailled documentation
